# Welcome to *gpaw-tools*
{: .fs-9 }

`gpaw-tools` is a powerful and user-friendly UI/GUI tool for conducting Density Functional Theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) calculations. Our goal is to make DFT and MD calculations more accessible and easy to use for individuals and small groups, by providing a simple command-line interface and graphical user interface.

The `gpaw-tools` package is built on top of the ASE, ASAP3, KIM-API, PHONOPY and GPAW libraries, which are well-established and widely used in the scientific community. It allows users to simulate the properties of materials, optimize structures, investigate chemical reactions and processes, and perform calculations on systems with a large number of atoms. With `gpaw-tools`, researchers, students, and engineers in a wide range of fields, including materials science, chemistry, physics, and engineering, can easily conduct DFT and MD calculations and explore the electronic, optical and phonon structure of material systems. We are constantly working to improve and expand the capabilities of `gpaw-tools`, and we welcome feedback and contributions from the community.

`gpaw-tools` have:
1. The main solver script `gpawsolver.py` which can be run in PW or LCAO mode. It can perform structure optimization, equation of state and elastic tensor calculations, use several different XCs (as well as hybrid XCs) for spin-polarized DOS and band structure calculations, electron densities, phonon calculations and optical properties (RPA and BSE). In addition to calculations, it can draw DOS and band structures, save all data and figure in an ordered way.
2. A force-field quick optimization script `asapsolve.py` for MD calculations using ASAP3 and OpenKIM potentials. 
3. To choose better cut off energy, lattice parameter and k-points, there are 4 scripts called `optimize_cutoff.py`, `optimize_kpoints.py`,`optimize_kptsdensity.py` and `optimize_latticeparam.py`.
4. A simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) for `gpawsolve.py` (and also you may say that GUI for GPAW) which is called `gg.py`.

## Citing
Please do not forget that, gpaw-tools is a UI/GUI software. For the main DFT calculations, it uses ASE and GPAW. It also uses Elastic python package for elastic tensor solutions and ASAP with KIM database for interatomic interaction calculations. Therefore, you must know what you use, and cite them properly. Here, the basic citation information of each packages are given.
